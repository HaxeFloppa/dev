# PUNIX
Punix is a lightweight project of mine that's designed to replicate that of a Unix feeling.

# Why?
Well, to go over why I had made this project:

- Usually, simulated operating systems made with python usually have very little to do in them. Sure, they have a fletched out users system, but that isn't enough to make such cool things like what many others have done with different languages.
- Well, I enjoy stuff like this since it's in my range of stuff I can do. Making operating systems is difficult to get used to and have as a common project, especially when you have to work with Assembly, the lowest of lowest level programming languages.
- Why not? As long as I enjoy working on such projects then yeah, I could pump shit like this out for the sake of doing it for fun.

Well, hope you enjoy this interesting creation, and change anything in the source code you wish! As long as you don't cause anything to break. Then that's your problem to fix.
